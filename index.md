<h1>ROBOT</h1>
<marquee behaviour="alternate" HEIGHT="200PX" >what is a robot?</marquee>
<p>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.<br>
Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.<br>
 Robots may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines designed to <br>
perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics.<br><br><br>

Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from <br>
humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility<br>
 (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial<br>
 robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy <br>
robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as<br>
 General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. <br>
By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot <br>
may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.<br>
 Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade,<br>
 with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers</p>
